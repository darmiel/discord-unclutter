# TeamSpeak Channels for Discord
![img](https://i.imgur.com/aHX3n0z.png)

Small Discord bot which creates a text channel for people who are in a voice channel.  
When a user enters a voice channel, a text channel is created if not available.  
Nobody (except the administrators) has access to this created text channel.  
Only when someone enters the corresponding voice channel, this individual gets access to the text channel.
